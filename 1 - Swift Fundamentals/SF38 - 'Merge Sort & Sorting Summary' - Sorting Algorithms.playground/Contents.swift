//  üèîÔ∏è MTECH Code Challenge SF38: "Merge Sort & Sorting Summary"
//  Concept: Review sorting algorithms and demonstrate a base level understanding of time complexity.

//  Instructions:
    //  Do some research on Merge Sort: üîóhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort
    //  Why is this sort more efficient than the other sorts we have learned?
    //  Why would we have you learn about sorting algorithms when there is a perfectly good .sort() function?
    //  Explain your answer in the /* */ comment marks below.

//  ‚å∫ Black Diamond Challenge:
    //  Include extra relevant information you learned in the black diamond challenges in your writing below.
    //  If you have not completed the other black diamond challenges, do those instead.

// MARK: Your response:

/*
 Merge Sorts are more efficient because...
 - It divides and conqures, allowing for a generally even workload
 
 We need to learn about sorting algorithms so that...
 - We have multiple ways to solve a variety of issues we come across.
 
 1. Other sorting algorithms were left to right, "Merge Sort" does everything almost all at once
 2. .sort() is great, but sometimes there will be a better way to go about solving a problem that requires sorting
